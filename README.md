# Sierpinski-Triangle

### Description

This is a basic program I made to familiarize myself with python and the turtle module. It draws a Sierpinski's triangle using a mathematical method.

This method consists in drawing the 3 apices of a triangle and then drawing a random dot within that triangle. After that we follow two simple rules:
1. Take the last point drawn and randomly select one of the apices
2. Draw a point in the middle of the two selected.

If you repeat this rules enough times you can see how the Sierpinski's triangle if being constructed.

[Here you have the visual explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgu5-3ihVVI) I used to do this in case you didn't understand it well enough.


### Usage

1. Open a terminal in the Sierpinski-Triangle directory.
2. Run this command: `python3 main.py`
3. Enter the asked values (leave blank to use the default ones).
4. Now the turtle will automatically start drawing, just wait until it finishes.
